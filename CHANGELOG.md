## 0.0.5

*   **New Feature**: Added `itemBubbleRadius` to `CustomGlassNavBar` for explicit control over the bubble size (defaults to `null` which uses logic or `circleSize`).
*   **Fix**: Resolved bubble position desynchronization issues.
*   **Fix**: Fixed issue where bubble would become invisible/misaligned due to correct `CustomPaint` sizing.
*   **Improvement**: Enhanced `GlassItemWidget` text animation for smoother transitions.
*   **Deprecated**: Migrated from `withOpacity` to `withValues` for future Flutter compatibility.

## 0.0.4

*   Initial release tweaks.
